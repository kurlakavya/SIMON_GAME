# Simon Game

This is a browser-based Simon Memory Game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game tests the player’s memory by generating a sequence of colors and sounds that the user must repeat correctly.

## Project Description

The Simon Game displays a circular interface divided into four colored sections: green, red, yellow, and blue. Each color represents a button with a unique sound. The game generates a random sequence, and the player must follow the same sequence in the correct order. With each successful round, the sequence length increases, making the game more challenging.

The game also includes a Strict Mode, which restarts the game if the player makes a mistake, and a normal mode, which allows the player to retry the same sequence.

## Technologies Used

- HTML – Used to structure the game layout and elements  
- CSS – Used for styling, layout design, and visual appearance  
- JavaScript – Used to implement game logic, event handling, sound, and animations
